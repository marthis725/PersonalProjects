Repository of my personal projects. 

"Fire Emblem Start" is my implementation of a Fire Emblem game, inspired by New Mystery of the Emblem. It contains basic elements such as fixed rng growth rates, terrain advantages, classes, and basic gameplay.
In the future, when the tileset, music, and sprites are replaced with royalty-free assets, the game can be published. 
At the moment, the game is still in development. It is predicted to finish its first draft version around early-mid December.
